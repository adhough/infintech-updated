I left my role in Investment Banking in August 2019 to pursue a career in Fintech having worked in the City of London for almost two decades. It was a bold move. For anyone considering a similar career move, this article is an honest accountof my experiences so far and I hope it provides useful information.\n</p>\n<br />\n\n<p>Firstly, a quick summary of my background. I have worked in a range of Financial Services roles (Finance, Risk and Projects) and asset classes (Derivatives, Fixed Income and Commodities). The roles which I enjoyed the most involved delivering Change. I love the challenge of designing and delivering user-friendly and robust solutions which meet the needs of the business. Earlier in my career I dealt with IT systems which were slow, error-prone and required work-arounds (and sometimes work-arounds for work-arounds). One of the major causes of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was the impact of poor-quality data on decision-making. Delivering projects to enable more accurate Risk and Financial management is very motivating for me. It also feels great when I hear that software or models which I was involved in delivering years ago, are still working well.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe biggest challenge when starting out is to not get overwhelmed by the amount of information available on Fintech via articles, blogs, podcasts, conferences etc. A lot of this information has little useful content for those starting out. The first step I took to get an overview of the Fintech sector was to take the ‘Around Fintech’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence in Finance’ online courses with the Centre for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship (CFTE). These courses have excellent content from academics and professionals working across the sector and they helped me to decide which areas within Fintech I wanted to focus on in the future. CFTE also organises regular events and seminars where it is possible to meet and network with other professionals working in Fintech.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nAt the end of 2019, I participated in the CFTE ‘Extrapreneurship’ course which involved teams around the world competing to deliver the best business plan for the UK-based Onfido’s expansion plans for Asia. Other Fintech firms which have been involved in this course previously include Neat and Revolut. The aim of the course is to simulate the experience of working in a start-up and to train students to develop a more entrepreneurial mindset. I really enjoyed working with my UK-based team to quickly grasp Onfido’s business model and research which countries and industries they should focus on for their future growth. We then developed a business plan, pitch deck and video presentation with our recommendations. Our team won the competition and Onfido confirmed that they would implement our recommendations.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nI am fascinated by the potential of AI to transform Financial Services and keen to learn about the models in more depth, so earlier this year I completed the ‘Stanford University Machine Learning’ course run by ‘Coursera’. I also wanted to strengthen my coding skills and I undertook the online Codeacademy ‘Data Science’ course and read a variety of text books. I found the O’Reilly ‘Head First’ series really useful for learning a computer language’s key concepts before moving onto more in-depth text books.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe most effective way of learning computer languages and frameworks is to start building projects as quickly as possible. Analysing which solutions are optimal for developing your projects and resolving defects helps to make the intricacies of languages and frameworks clearer (during my career in Banking I became proficient at Excel and VBA as a result of building many models for testing, reconciling and reporting Risk and Financial data). Over the last few months I have been building websites using Python, Docker containers, and PostgreSQL databases. I have been using the Django framework for these projects due to it being secure, easy to set up database tables via models and great for learning how the back-end (underlying database and logic) through to the front-end (user-interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) components work for websites. I found the ‘Django for Beginners’ textbook by William S Vincent an excellent starting point. I have launched my projects using Heroku which is a platform as a service (PaaS) and it is free for developers starting out.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe first website I built was <a href=\"https://agile-project-tracker.herokuapp.com/tracker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://agile-project-tracker.herokuapp.com/tracker/</a> (enter username ‘demo_user’ and password ‘read_only’ to view) which allows me to track, manage and prioritise my Projects and Tasks (or Epics and Stories). I use this website to manage my projects using Agile project management methodologies.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nFor my next project I remembered from working in the Loans Market that there are no free resources on the internet for users in the Loan Market to calculate the Average One Month Libor rate and Cost of Carry. I built a simple website (<a href=\"https://avglibor.herokuapp.com/estimator/\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://avglibor.herokuapp.com/estimator/</a>) which allows users to select a date range, loan amount and loan price and it applies calculations on Libor data stored in the database and returns the results to the user. It would be helpful to get more feedback from users to help refine the algorithm used in this website. If it is useful, I would be keen to improve the User Interface, increase the range of dates available (currently from 1st January 2019 to the present date) and also to extend to other currencies (presently just USD).\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nI aim to keep challenging myself to learn new Python concepts and to continue increasing the complexity of the problems I am trying to solve. I built a Securitisation website (<a href=\"https://secmodel.herokuapp.com/\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://secmodel.herokuapp.com/</a>) using Flask, Python and Postgresql which enables users to change inputs such as coupons, prepayment rates, default rates and loss-given-default rates and then compare the impact on projected cash flows.\nI also built a FX Risk Model (<a href=\"https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/</a>) which calculates the one day Value at Risk (VaR) for a UK-based investor’s portfolio of assets held in currencies such as Australian Dollars (AUD), Canadian Dollars (CAD), Swiss Francs (CHF), Euros (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and US Dollars (USD). In the near-future I also want to build projects using Artificial Intelligence models, develop REST APIs (representational state transfer application program interface) and learn more about JavaScript libraries (such as ReactJS) to develop user interfaces which look more professional.\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <p>\n\nAlong with everyone reading this article, my family and I have been adversely impacted by Coronavirus. It has been a shock to Fintech Sector and the wider economy and it has been a challenge juggling job-hunting and training whilst supporting my two Primary School aged sons during this unique period. But I am determined to be proactive in developing my skills and learning about a sector which I believe will revolutionise our way of life in the coming decades. For anyone looking to make a similar career change, I sincerely hope that this article has had useful tips and I wish you best of luck.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div className='project-btns'>\n    <Button\n      className='btns'\n      buttonStyle='btn--outline'\n      buttonSize='btn--large'\n    >\n      ARTICLES\n      </Button>\n\n      </div>\n\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default FintechSection;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/London_2.4a4837b6.jpg\";","\nimport React from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport { Button } from './ArticlesButton';\nimport './OpenBanking.css';\nimport London from './images/London_2.jpg'\n\nfunction OpenBankingSection() {\n  return (\n    <div className='openbanking-container'>\n\n    <div className='project-btns'>\n    <Button\n      className='btns'\n      buttonStyle='btn--outline'\n      buttonSize='btn--large'\n    >\n      ARTICLES\n      </Button>\n\n      </div>\n\n    <img src={London} alt=\"london\"></img>\n      <div className='open-article-container'>\n\n<h1>What is Open Banking?</h1>\n<h3>(First published July 2020)</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Over the last few decades, banks have not been disrupted to the same degree which industries such as media and retail have experienced.  Many consumers had their bank accounts set up when they were a child and then go on to use their bank’s products and services for the majority of their financial needs. This near monopoly over transaction history made it difficult for customers to actively seek out better financial deals and has resulted in minimal competition between banks.  Regulators around the world are encouraging Open Banking to increase competition and promote innovation and it is set to revolutionise financial services. However, what is Open Banking and how will it impact consumers, banks and Fintech start-ups over the coming years?\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe key technology which enables Open Banking is the Application Programming Interface (or API) which allows developers to build applications which connect business processes, services, content and data in a straight-forward and secure way. Developers can access services and resources in real-time from other pieces of software which they did not build.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nAfter receiving consent from the consumer, third-party firms can access data held at the bank, such as current account transactions. Using this data, third-party firms can develop cheaper, time-saving and more user-friendly products. Consumers will also take more control of their data and understand its value – they can see who is using their data and have the authority to permit, refuse and revoke access. It will also be easier for consumers to compare the fees and the performance of banks, transfer their accounts, manage payments and conduct transactions through other banks and non-banks.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe opportunity for more financial service providers to access historical data will lead to more competition for credit products, such as personal loans. New entrants will be able to analyse historical transaction data which was previously only accessible by the consumer’s bank. There will also be more personalised comparison between the products and services of different providers. We will see a change in the business model of retail banks from being the sole provider of financial products and services to operating a market-place where consumers can compare alternatives from a wider range of providers.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe UK and EU have been the pioneers in Open Banking Regulation. The ‘Competition and Markets Authority’ (CMA) in the UK and the second ‘Payment Services Directive’ (PSD2) in the EU enables customers to allow approved third-parties to access their data for free. Banks in the UK have been required by law to comply since January 2018 and in the EU since September 2019. Australia followed the lead of the UK and EU in legislating for Open Banking but included an additional measure to ensure that Fintechs also share data with banks. Other countries are encouraging Open Banking by taking a more ‘market-friendly’ approach, such as Singapore, where banks are not required by law to share their data. In Singapore, banks and Fintechs experiment and develop new products and services and then check the suitability with regulators.  When comparing the regulatory approaches made by Europe and Singapore, it is too early to determine which will lead to the best outcomes for consumers. It will likely depend more on factors such as how tech savvy consumers are and how keen they are for greater choice.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nBanks previously covered all aspects of the value chain – from origination and servicing, through to risk and balance sheet management. The future ecosystem will be a complex mix of competition and collaboration between banks and Fintechs. Banks will decide which customer segments, products, services and risk profiles they want to focus on and whether to build applications in-house or partner with start-ups. In the scenario where banks and Fintech start-ups collaborate, banks will compete on being the preferred partner. For products and services where banks do not have a competitive edge or it is outside their risk appetite, banks can look to maintain the customer relationship and offer third-party options via a marketplace.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nOpen Banking has the potential to transform Retail Banking and consumers are set to benefit from increased competition and innovation. To succeed in this new environment, banks and Fintechs need to develop a culture of experimentation, understand the needs and preferences of their consumers to a deeper degree and regularly test which product and service mix they need to be focusing on. Beyond ease of use, ensuring the security and reliability of the new platforms will be key factors for building customer trust.</p>\n\n    </div>\n    <div className='project-btns'>\n    <Button\n      className='btns'\n      buttonStyle='btn--outline'\n      buttonSize='btn--large'\n    >\n      ARTICLES\n      </Button>\n\n      </div>\n\n      </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default OpenBankingSection;\n","\nimport React from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport { Button } from './ArticlesButton';\nimport './FXMarket.css';\nimport FXMarket from './images/FXmarket.jpeg'\n\nfunction FXMarketSection() {\n  return (\n    <div className='fxmarket-container'>\n\n    <div className='project-btns'>\n    <Button\n      className='btns'\n      buttonStyle='btn--outline'\n      buttonSize='btn--large'\n    >\n      ARTICLES\n      </Button>\n\n      </div>\n\n    <img src={FXMarket} alt=\"fx\"></img>\n      <div className='fx-article-container'>\n\n<h1>Foreign Exchange: Background and Opportunities</h1>\n<h3>(Published September 2020)</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Ten years ago, I analysed and reported the market risk exposure and profit and loss for the Foreign Exchange (FX) desk at a leading Investment Bank.  It is a really fascinating market because so many factors can lead to changes in FX rates.  With daily transaction volumes in the trillions, the FX market is the largest financial market in the world. Participants include governments, banks, international corporations, hedge funds and individual investors. Over the last decade, this market has also been disrupted by new technology and Fintech platforms.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nIn this article I explore how the FX Market has evolved and what are the challenges that need to be overcome to make it cheaper, faster, safer and more transparent. I present highlights from a correlation analysis where I looked for relationships between economic data and FX rates. Also, a much broader range of companies and investors - beyond just Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Multinationals - will hold assets in foreign countries and I introduce a model which will help them to manage their FX Risk (<a href=\"https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/</a>).\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Background</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe FX market has been around for as long as trade has taken place between countries and regions which hold different currencies. In medieval Italy, fortunes were made in money lending and currency trading. A church ban on charging interest led bankers, known as the Lombards, to lend money in one currency and then adjust the FX rate to accommodate for interest.  In the 19th century, the major currencies in the world, such as the British Pound, German Mark and US Dollar were backed by gold. With the onset of the Great Depression and World War Two, major economies moved off the gold standard. After World War Two, the Bretton Woods Agreement established a fixed exchange rate system where major European currencies were pegged to the US Dollar, making it the reserve currency of the world.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe Bretton Woods system started to break down in the late 1960’s due to rising US inflation and gold convertibility was suspended in 1968. In the late 1970’s major European economies agreed to maintain exchange rates which led to the establishment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. In 1992, the Quantum Hedge Fund took short positions in the British Pound, believing it was overvalued, which forced the United Kingdom to leave the Exchange Rate Mechanism and this led to the exchange rate trading bands changing from 2.25% to 15%[1]. This move to a more floating exchange rate system in Europe led to demands to establish a single currency and the Euro went live at the start of 1999.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Peer-to-Peer Platforms</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe last decade has seen the emergence of Fintechs offering more competitive FX rates, a wider range of products and lower fees. There has been a focus on Cross Border Payments which involves transferring funds to a recipient located in a different jurisdiction. Fintechs, such as TransferWise and Kantox, offer their clients Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platforms. These services cut out the middle man and enable users, located around the world, to trade between themselves. For example, imagine an Australian living in the UK, who needs to make regular payments (such as mortgage payments) in Australian dollars. Using the P2P platforms, they could search for someone in Australia who needs to make similar payments in British pounds, agree on FX rates and when and to which accounts the payments will take place (the Australian-based party makes payments in Australian Dollars and the UK-based party makes the payments in British Pounds). This model is most commonly used for currencies such as the US Dollar, Euros and Yen, where there are always people looking to exchange currencies, but it is more difficult for currencies that are traded less and where parties want to exchange large amounts.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Cross-Border Payments</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nP2P platforms are not accessible to all firms and individuals who need to make cross-border payments. According to the World Bank, the cost of making cross-border payments is on average 7% and there is a wide dispersion depending on the locations of the sender and recipient. A United Nations ‘Sustainable Development Goal’ is to reduce the cost of remittances to 3% by 2030[2].\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nFactors such as time for dispute resolution, reconciliations, slow processes, operational opening times and compliance checks (such as checks for money laundering) lead to delays. Compliance checks can occur several times for one payment as it moves along a payment chain. Different processes, sanction lists and databases can lead to delays and rejections of payments. The lack of standardisation of systems, messaging and processing standards limits the ability to process payments more efficiently[3]. Governments and Regulators need to collaborate and promote more consistent international rules and standards.  Companies involved in Cross-Border payments need to migrate from legacy platforms and increase the operational hours of clearing and settling these payments.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Correlation Analysis</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nWith the rise in e-commerce and the increasing mobility of people and capital combined with an increasing range of banking services available (please see 'What is Open Banking?'), more small-medium sized enterprises (SME) and individual investors will hold larger amounts of assets outside of their home location.  They will need to understand, manage and possibly hedge their FX risk exposures. To look for relationships between economic data and currencies, I undertook correlation analysis using economic data from the IMF, OECD & World Bank (please see <a href=\"https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/corr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/corr</a>). I looked at the FX rates from the perspective of a UK-based investor who holds a portfolio of currency positions in Australian Dollars (AUD), Canadian Dollars (CAD), Swiss Francs (CHF), Euros (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and US Dollars (USD). Correlations were calculated using the percentage change over time.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nMy first finding was that many of the currencies were moderately positively correlated with other currencies.  AUDGDP with NZDGDP, CADGDP with USDGDP and CHFGDP with EURGDP currency movements highlight how closely these economies are integrated. In fact, the Swiss Franc is often more sensitive to changes in French and German economic data than the Euro.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nCorrelations between FX rates and interest rates were not strong, however there was moderate negative correlation between JPYGBP FX rate and UK and US long term interest rates[4]. Japan is a safe haven so at times of economic stress investors buy Japanese assets, whilst more optimistic investors buy assets in the likes of the UK and US.  This can also be seen in the strong negative correlation between US GBP (PPP) and JPY[5].\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nOECD Energy Supply[6], G20 Oil production[7] and German inland freight[8] are all negatively correlated with CHFGBP and EURGBP. We need to assess whether these changes in the economy are impacting exchange rates or vice-versa. For example, I believe that demand for importing energy can have a material impact on FX rates whilst changes in freight are more likely a result of firms and individuals changing their demand for imported goods due to changes in FX rates. The ability of German firms to successfully export their manufactured goods is assisted with depreciations in the Euro. This is demonstrated by the strong negative correlation between German Industry as a percentage of GDP[9] and the EURGBP.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThere was moderate positive correlation between Chinese Industry as a percentage of GBP[10] and AUDGBP, CADGBP and NZDGBP. When China prioritised investing in infrastructure through to 2011, Australia, Canada and New Zealand exported raw materials to China and their currencies appreciated strongly against other currencies such as GBP.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>FX Risk Model</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe above examples selected had the strongest correlations in my analysis. It is very difficult to find relationships between economic data and changes in FX rates.  Many movements in FX rates appear random.  With this in mind, I believe that SMEs and individuals holding a portfolio of foreign currencies should manage their FX Risk exposure by using a Value at Risk (VaR) model using the historical simulation method (with over 15 years of FX rate data). I have developed a website with this model (<a href=\"https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://fxriskmodel.herokuapp.com/</a>) where the user can input their AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, JPY, NZD & USD asset amounts. The model then returns the value of their portfolio using the close of business FX rates and estimates the worst possible one-day loss of the portfolio using 95% and 99% confidence intervals. ﻿This model is measuring the FX risk and not other risk factors such as equity, interest or credit risk. An extreme event could lead to losses much larger than estimated by this model. Please contact me with any feedback about this website.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Conclusion</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nGlobal Co-operation between Governments, Regulators, Financial Services and Fintechs is required to reduce the cost of Cross-Border payments and to meet consumer demand for seamless, transparent and real-time processing. The World Bank estimated in 2018 that 77% of remittances went to low/middle income countries and that these payments are common during times of crisis, such as natural disasters[11]. Reducing the costs of remittances can help get more money into the hands of people who need it. Making these payments faster, cheaper and more transparent will support economic growth, international trade, global development and financial inclusion.  We also need to look at developing new digital tools to help the growing numbers of SMEs and individual investors who will need to manage their FX Risk exposures.\n\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Disclaimer</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThis article is for information purposes only and is not intended as financial or investment advice.

After over 15 years working in Investment Banking, last year I left my role to pursue a career in Fintech. I am proud of the projects I previously worked on and I also enjoyed working with many very smart and talented people.  However, the scandals in Investment Banking over the past decade have damaged the reputation of organisations, harmed employee morale and undermined trust in the industry.  I believe that these scandals occurred due to two key reasons: leverage and the complexity.  The Fintech industry faces similar exposures to these risks and needs to take steps now to prevent financial scandals from occurring.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Leverage</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nLeverage in financial services is the investment strategy of using borrowed capital or financial products such as options in order to increase the rate of return on an investment.  Banking is an industry where the decisions and actions of just a few people can lead large gains and also large losses.  In 2012, traders at member banks who submitted rates to calculate Libor (the London Inter-bank Offered Rate), were discovered colluding to falsely inflate and deflate the official Libor rate to profit from positions they held.  Libor is used to value a wide range of financial products such as derivatives, mortgages and student loans.  Fixing these rates led to the incorrect valuation of countless financial products around the world.  Since this scandal was discovered, billions of dollars of fines have been paid and the financial system’s reputation has been severely damaged.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Complexity</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe complexity of many financial products and businesses is another cause of scandals.  Often, highly trained and experienced financial professionals are unable to fully grasp many financial products and business models.  Behind this complexity, insiders are able to act without proper scrutiny.  Barings Bank collapsed in 1995 due to poor risk management and controls, where senior management did not understand the risks of the trading strategies taking place in Singapore.  The manager of trading in Singapore, Nick Leeson, was also the manager of settlements (controlling the division’s cash payments and receivables) and he was able to hide his trading losses without being detected before his fraud and losses were discovered.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis was caused by a wide range of factors.  At the centre of the crisis were highly complicated and leveraged financial products with risks which few people (both inside and outside of Investment Banks) properly understood.  Participants in these markets overlooked (or did not comprehend) the risks.  Their actions severely damaged their clients, their organisations, financial markets and society.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nAt Wirecard, the highly opaque and international business structure, made it difficult for regulators, auditors and the media (despite brave reporting from the ‘Financial Times’) to understand the business model of the company.  Behind this complexity, a range of illegal actions took place, such as inflating reported earnings and cash flow, which led to the firm’s insolvency this year.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<b>Values and Ethics</b>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nDue to the leverage and complexity of their products, markets and technology, Fintech firms are exposed to similar risks of scandals as banks.  Fintech firms need to take steps to prevent financial scandals in the future.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nStart-ups have an advantage over established companies because they can embed values and ethics from the outset.  The values of a Fintech, whether a start-up or more established firm, are its unique set of beliefs and ideals, reflecting what is important to that particular firm.  Ethics is a guideline of conduct that is common across firms and society.  While values must be clear, actionable and relatable to day-to-day activities and provide a foundation for the culture and decision-making of a company, ethics set out a commitment to high standards. Both values and ethics must be implemented, monitored and governed to have a positive impact.  Ethics need to focus on protecting the interests of stakeholders such as employees, customers and society and they need to be deeply imbedded in the culture of the company so that everyone is thinking, “is this right” rather than just “is this legal”.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nLegal and regulatory guidance lags well behind the technical innovation and organisational practices in Fintech. Start-ups should establish Ethics and Governance committees with diverse views, perspectives and a range of both technical and non-technical backgrounds. These Committees need to focus on protecting the interests of stakeholders and their findings should be communicated across the firm.  Setting up an Ethics and Governance Committee is a challenge for early-stage start-ups, but even a small committee can review outcomes and provide guidance.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nHow governments and consumers view the Fintech industry over the coming years will depend on the impact of its technology and the trust it can build in society. To achieve this, a body of case studies, standards, precedents and a shared knowledge base needs to be developed. Fintech firms need to collaborate and share their experiences with ethical issues and regulators and industry associations need to provide support to build an industry-wide ethics knowledge base.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nThe culture of companies is set from the top. Leaders need to be careful about the intention of their actions and also how their actions will be interpreted. They must highlight positive examples to reinforce the correct things people are doing in the firm and embed values and ethics in interviews and performance evaluations.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nFor anyone working in Fintech, high uncertainty, stressful workplaces, long working hours, temptations and rationalisations can lead to unethical behaviour.  As per the article, ‘Building an Ethical Career’ (HBR), developing ‘if-then’ planning an help when difficult situations arise[3]. Contemplating decisions, keeping a perspective and reflecting on decisions can help to improve everyone’s decision-making process.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\nI am confident that the Fintech industry can positively impact lives and develop a reputation as an ethical industry.  To create long-term sustainable value, there is no trade-off between acting ethically and successfully scaling Fintech start-ups. Let’s start by making values and ethics a priority and debate how Wirecard-like scandals can be prevented from happening.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n[1] McCrum, D and Storbeck, O (2020), ‘Wirecard says €1.9bn of cash is missing’, Financial Times, 18th June 2020, Available at: https://www.ft.com/content/1e753e2b-f576-4f32-aa19-d240be26e773, (Accessed: August 2020)\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n[2] Storbeck et al.
